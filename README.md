# Frontend Assignment 

## Expectations on the app
- A reddit-like webpage, that allows users to post posts, comment on those posts and react to both posts and comments.
- Use any API you want to mock post data, but DummyJSON was recommended for its useful documentation and lack of need for an API key (i.e. simple and easy to use for beginners)
- use only HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks/libraries like angular, react, bootrstrap etc.

## Results
My take on how a reddit-like webpage may look like.
